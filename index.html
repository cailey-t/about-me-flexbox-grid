            <p>I am a learning <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span>
                who is interested in visual storytelling and the best user experience. When I'm not studying, or working
                my current day job, I can be found lost in the rabbit hole of books and video games, finding calm in a
                yoga studio, or traveling to search for new adventures.</p>

        <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
            <p>I was born and raised in Southern California, and lived there for 29 years. My partner and I moved to
                Texas for a fresh start in October 2020. Yes, that's right, in the middle of Covid. I love living in
                Texas, but the part about California I miss the most, other than my family, is being able to drive to
                the beach in under 30 minutes!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
            <p>My favorite place I've traveled to is Montana. Taking in the incredible views, with the people I love
                most in this world is what made me realize that I wanted to change my career! Want a career that I will
                enjoy and also be able to enjoy the things I love outside of work.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
            <p>Fun Fact: I have a Math degree and a Cosmetology license! After Covid, I knew I did not want to continue
                down the Cosmetology path. I fell back to a career I was comfortable with while getting settled in
                Texas. But I have made the choice to better myself and my skills and pursue something I can truly see
                myself doing long term!</p>
